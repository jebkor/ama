Here you can send me your ask-[me](https://blog.jebkor.dk/about-me)-anything questions. I like this format, because it defers from the "standard" blog-comment, like or email kind of deal.

### Ask a question

How do you ask a question, you ask? Well, it's as easy as
[creating a new issue](https://github.com/jebkor/ama/issues/new) on this
project. 

Any (reasonable) question asked, I'll answer. And as quickly as possible as well. Once I answer the question, I'll close the
issue just so I have a rough idea which questions has been covered. If you want, you can continue ask questions in old, closed questions but new issues (questions) will be more likely to be read ☺️

### Read some questions

You can check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/jebkor/ama/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
filter on this repository to checkout any already answered questions. I try
to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig
into some of the older threads.

### Twitter

If you don't like this format, just shoot me a DM on Twitter. The new 280 character format creates new possibilities. 
I'm [@jebkor_](https://twitter.com/jebkor)!
